# Styling: SCSS vs Tailwind — Comparison & Decision Guide

> English is canonical; [`styling-scss-vs-tailwind.zh-CN.md`](./styling-scss-vs-tailwind.zh-CN.md) is the
> synced translation.
> This doc explains why the fork is migrating component styling from hand-written SCSS to Tailwind
> utilities, what genuinely cannot be expressed as a Tailwind *utility*, and (for completeness) the
> cases where SCSS remains the right tool.

## 1. Context

> **Status (2026-09): the migration described here is complete.** The SCSS layer and the `sass`
> devDependency are fully removed from `packages/seal-editor` (src no longer contains any `.scss`);
> component styling is Tailwind utilities plus the thin plain-CSS layer. The doc is kept as the
> decision record for that migration and as guidance for new surfaces.

The fork historically vendored **two parallel styling systems**:

- A global `src/styles/tailwind.css` (Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`), plus `tokens.css` which
  bridges the live seed-derived runtime tokens (`--grl-*`) to generic names (`--border`, `--primary`,
  …). All shadcn/ui and ReUI components are styled with Tailwind utilities.
- ~2 700 lines of hand-written SCSS (`dg.scss`, `dt.scss`, `ce.scss`, `expression.scss`,
  `function.scss`, `_builder-base.scss` + builders, `decision-node.scss`, `styles.scss`), compiled by
  the `sass` devDependency — since collapsed into Tailwind utilities + the plain-CSS layer and removed.

> **Editor chrome surfaces.** Colors for third-party editor DOM that have no antd counterpart —
> CodeMirror tooltips (`--tooltip-bg`), diagnostic chips (`--diagnostic-chip-bg`) and the Monaco
> error-line decoration (`--error-line-bg`) — live in `tokens.css` with explicit
> `[data-mode='light']` / `[data-mode='dark']` blocks. Define new editor-surface colors there (not
> in `tailwind.css` and not under the runtime-injected `--grl-*` namespace) so dark mode keeps
> working; see §8.

## 2. What a "utility class" is

Tailwind takes a **single CSS property per class name** and lets you compose them in `className`:

```tsx
// equivalent to: .box { display:flex; align-items:center; gap:8px; padding:8px; }
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 p-2">…</div>
```

Tailwind is **build-time**: it scans the source for literal `className="…"` strings and only emits CSS
for the classes it finds (`@tailwindcss/vite` + `@source '../'` in `tailwind.css`). It supports
variants (`hover:`, `dark:`, `focus-within:`, `data-[state=open]:`, `not-last:`), pseudo-elements
(`after:content-['']`), and arbitrary values `bg-[#ff0000]` / `text-[var(--x)]` / `[top:calc(50% - 1px)]`.

## 3. Comparison

| Dimension | SCSS (preprocessor) | Tailwind (utility-first) |
|---|---|---|
| **Authoring** | Separate `.scss` files, nesting + `&` + module system (`@use`/`@include`) | Classes in JSX; `@theme`, `@layer`, `@custom-variant` in CSS |
| **Build** | Runtime compile by `sass`; ships all 2 700 lines | Build-time scan; emits only used classes (smaller CSS) |
| **Reuse** | `@mixin` / `@include` shared partials | Duplicate utility string, or a shared React component |
| **Variables** | `$vars` + `sass math` (compile-time) | CSS custom properties (`--*`), `@theme inline` |
| **Runtime data-driven values** | Not a concern — you already use inline `style` / CSS vars | Same: use inline `style` or CSS vars; **never** build a class name at runtime |
| **Nested / pseudo states** | `&:hover`, `&::after`, `&:not(:last-child)` | `hover:`, `after:`, `not-last:`, `focus-within:` |
| **Deep selectors into 3rd-party DOM** | Easy, readable nesting | Possible via `[&_li>div+label+span]:hidden` but unmaintainable |
| **Computed token chains** | `$h: calc($fs * $lh + …)` once, reuse | Needs a CSS custom property (`--b-h`) held on the element |

## 4. What CANNOT be a Tailwind utility (but can be plain CSS)

The real boundary is **utility vs plain CSS**, **not SCSS vs Tailwind**. Three cases fall on the
plain-CSS side and never need Sass:

1. **Third-party DOM hooks.** Monaco line decorations apply a class *name* to DOM Monaco creates
   (`function.tsx` passes `className: 'grl-function__errorLineContent'` to
   `createDecorationsCollection`). A utility cannot be attached — a real CSS rule keyed by that class
   is required. Same for `react-json-tree` internals in `function-debugger-log.tsx`
   (`li > div + label + span`, `.log__values > ul:first-of-type > li:first-of-type`).

2. **Dynamically computed token values.** `_builder-base.scss` derives `--b-height`/`--b-max-height`
   with `calc(var(--b-font-size) * var(--b-line-height) + …)`. Tailwind utilities are statically
   generated; the computed value is carried instead by a CSS custom property on the element.

3. **Dynamic SVG data-URIs from function arguments.** See §6.

These live as a small **plain-CSS layer** (e.g. a "third-party DOM hooks" section in `tailwind.css`),
not as SCSS.

## 5. Runtime, data-driven coloring (nodes / edges / API)

"Node type decides edge color" and "color from an API return value" are **JS-computed at runtime**,
so they belong in **inline `style` or CSS variables** — independent of SCSS/Tailwind and always
available:

```tsx
// Edge color derived from a diff/status at runtime (custom-edge.tsx does exactly this)
<BaseEdge style={{
  ...(style || {}),
  stroke: match(diff)
    .with({ status: 'added' }, () => 'var(--grl-color-success)')
    .with({ status: 'removed' }, () => 'var(--grl-color-error)')
    .otherwise(() => undefined),
}} />

// Node color from data
<Node style={{ borderColor: nodeTypeColor(node.type) }} />
```

- **One dynamic-off value** → inline `style`.
- **A small enumerated palette** → literal class names backed by CSS variables, e.g.
  `className="fill-[var(--node-color-purple)]"` with the var flipped at runtime (the fork already
  exposes `--node-color-*` in `theme.tsx`).
- **Never** interpolate a class at runtime (`text-[${color}]`) — those classes are never scanned, so
  they don't exist in generated CSS.

None of this requires reintroducing SCSS.

## 6. The one genuinely SCSS-specific construct

`ce.scss` defines a `@function lintRangeImage($color, $stroke-width)` that returns an inline SVG
`data:image/svg+xml,…` with its color and stroke-width interpolated from the arguments. Tailwind
cannot generate a string from arguments — but this needs **plain CSS / a data-URI string**, not Sass.
It is eliminated either by precomputing the URI as a static value (or a tiny JS helper), so `sass` can
still be removed.

## 7. SCSS applicable scenarios (when it is still the right tool)

Being balanced: even in a Tailwind codebase, a few cases genuinely favour a preprocessor. Use SCSS
when you need **compile-time** computation or reuse that utilities can't describe cleanly:

1. **Value-producing `@function`s** — e.g. `lintRangeImage($color, $w)` building a data-URI from
   arguments. This is the clearest SCSS-only win (until you settle on a fixed URI).
2. **Deep styling of third-party DOM you don't own**, with complex combinators
   (`li > div + label + span`). SCSS nesting keeps it readable; the Tailwind arbitrary-variant
   equivalent (`[&_li>div+label+span]:hidden`) is hard to read and maintain.
3. **Build-time mixins reused across several components**, when you'd otherwise duplicate a long
   utility string in multiple TSX files and a shared React component isn't warranted.
4. **Computed token chains / layout math** that derive multiple values from a few base tokens
   (`--b-height`, `--b-max-height`), especially when those values feed several rules.
5. **Loops / conditional generation** (`@each`, `@for`, `@if`) producing many variants — e.g.
   generating a strip of shade classes at build time.
6. **Theme token system without Tailwind `@theme`** — if you keep a token layer in `$vars` and rely on
   `sass math` for contrast/lightness adjustments.

**Caveat:** most "SCSS needs" in items 2–4 are actually satisfiable with **plain CSS** (nesting,
`@custom-variant`, CSS custom properties) now that native CSS nesting is mainstream. Use a
preprocessor only where you need **values computed at compile time from function/mixin arguments**
(items 1, 5, 6) — otherwise prefer utilities + a thin plain-CSS layer.

## 8. Recommended target for this fork

- **Where possible** → Tailwind utilities (layout, spacing, states, colours).
- **Third-party DOM hooks + token arithmetic + data-URIs** → a small plain-CSS layer (in
  `src/styles/tailwind.css` or a co-located `.css`), never SCSS.
- **Runtime data-driven values** → inline `style` / CSS variables.
- **Migration order** → smallest, self-contained SCSS `function.scss` first (utilities + a couple of
  plain-CSS hooks), then the intertwined builder module trio (which shares `_builder-base.scss`),
  then the large `dg.scss`/`ce.scss`/`dt.scss` batch, deleting each `.scss` as it converts.
- **End state** → no `sass` dependency, one styling paradigm, no loss of styling capability.

## 9. Migration vocabulary & hazards (reading the conversion commits)

These terms appear throughout the SCSS→Tailwind conversion commits. They describe **how a chunk of
hand-written CSS is classified** before you decide whether to delete it, utility-sweep it, or keep it
as plain CSS.

### Dead code vs. live interactive UI

- **Dead code** — a rule whose selector matches **no** rendered DOM node. It never fires, so removing
  it is **zero visual change**. Example: the builder SCSS targeted antd internals
  (`.ant-select-selector`, `.ant-picker-input`, `.ant-popover-inner`) that the migrated primitives no
  longer emit. A DOM probe showed every one of those selectors matched `0` nodes while the component
  still mounted.
- **Live interactive UI** — a rule that genuinely styles elements the user can see and operate, and
  carries **pseudo-class/state** logic. When you remove or change it the appearance changes. Example:
  the operator picker (`.op-tile`, `.op-row`, `.op-trigger`, `.op-search`) and the value chips
  (`.eb-chip`) — each with `:hover`, `.active`, `.disabled`, `:focus`, `::placeholder` states.

To classify a rule, **probe the real DOM** (Playwright: count `document.querySelectorAll('.ant-x')`
while the story renders). Counts of `0` ⇒ dead; non-zero ⇒ live.

### Hazards when converting a live interactive module

1. **Per-state regression.** A static screenshot is not enough — you must open the popover, hover,
   select, search and type, in **both light and dark** themes. Each state maps to a Tailwind variant
   (`hover:`, `disabled:`, `focus:`, `placeholder:`) or a conditional `active` class.
2. **Portal scoping.** Popover/dropdown content renders in a **portal** outside the component root
   (Radix portals into `<body>`). CSS custom properties declared on the component root (`.eb,
   .op-dropdown-popover`) will **not** cascade into portal content, so scoped vars like
   `--bg-light` / `--bg-active` / `--color-active-text` must be re-declared on the portal root too.
   This is why antd's build declared them in multiple places.
3. **Computed token chains.** Values derived with `calc()` from other custom properties — e.g.
   `--b-height = calc(var(--b-font-size) * var(--b-line-height) + var(--b-v-padding) * 2)` —
   cannot become Tailwind utilities. They stay as plain CSS custom properties (see §4).
4. **Cross-file coupling.** A custom property set on one component may be read by a *different*
   stylesheet. Example: `builder-code` (in the builder SCSS) sets `--ce-lineHeight` /
   `--ce-verticalPadding` / `--ce-horizontalPadding`, which `ce.scss` consumes in
   `max-height: calc(3px + var(--editorMaxRows) * var(--ce-lineHeight) + …)`. If you change how the
   code element is styled you must keep exporting those vars.

### Checklist for converting a live interactive module

1. Probe the DOM; delete the truly-dead selectors first (safe, zero visual change).
2. Keep computed token chains (`--b-*`, `--bg-*`, `--color-active-text`) as plain CSS custom
   properties; don't turn them into utilities.
3. If the subtree renders in a portal, re-declare the scoped vars on the portal root.
4. Map each pseudo-class / side-activated state to a Tailwind variant or a conditional class.
5. Sweep the layout/spacing/static-colour rules to utilities in the JSX.
6. Verify interactively (open, hover, select, search) plus vitest/typecheck/lint, in light **and** dark.
