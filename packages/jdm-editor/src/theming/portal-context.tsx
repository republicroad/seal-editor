 * JdmConfigProvider resolves the nearest `.seal-root` ancestor once on mount
 * and publishes the container element here. Every Radix portal in
 * `components/ui/*` reads it so popovers/dialogs/selects mount INSIDE the
 * island that owns their theme variables — enabling multiple independently-
 * themed islands on one page and bringing the scoped preflight (box-sizing
 * etc.) back over portaled nodes (HK-14 systemic closure).
 *
 * Undefined = no `.seal-root` ancestor → portals fall back to document.body
 * and the provider falls back to global `:root` injection (legacy hosts).
